SHELL

1. An infinite while loop
2. Take user input
  a. We will need getline()
3. Tokenize user input by whitespace (" ")
  a. We will need strtok()
4. Check if the first element of the new input exists
  a. If full path, like /bin/ls, check if the file exists
  b. If just name, try to get the file path through PATH env variable
  c. We will need stat() or access()
5. Create an array based on the path of the program and the given arguments
  a. example: ls -la /tmp
    - ls => program
    - the remaining are arguments
  b. same for /bin/ls -la /tmp
  c. You will have to setup the array from step 4, array is like
    - *arr[] = {program, ...args, NULL};
    - first element is the program
    - remaining elements are its arguments
    - last element is NULL
6. Execute the program with its arguments, don't forget to give the global environ as third parameters
  a. We will need fork() and execve()
